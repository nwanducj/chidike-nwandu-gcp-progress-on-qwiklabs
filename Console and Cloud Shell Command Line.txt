Assignment 2
Console and Cloud Shell 
1. gsutil mb gs://example-bucket112

Task 3: Create a bucket using Cloud Shell
1. gsutil mb gs://example-bucket113

Task 4: Explore more Cloud Shell features


    *Open Cloud Shell.*

    *Click the three dots (b4af82f98f85f64f.png) icon in the Cloud Shell toolbar to display further options.*

    *Click Upload file. Upload any file from your local machine to the Cloud Shell VM. This file will be referred to as [MY_FILE].*

    *In Cloud Shell, type ls to confirm that the file was uploaded.*

    *Copy the file into one of the buckets you created earlier in the lab. Replace [MY_FILE] with the file you uploaded and [BUCKET_NAME] with one of your bucket names:*
export BUCKET_NAME=example_bucket112.txt
export MY_FILE=MY_TEXT.txt
echo $MY_FILE
gsutil cp [MY_FILE] gs://[BUCKET_NAME]

Task 5: Create a persistent state in Cloud Shell
1. gcloud compute regions list
INFRACLASS_REGION=[us-central1]
echo $INFRACLASS_REGION

I. Append the environment variable to a file
mkdir infraclass
touch infraclass/config
echo INFRACLASS_REGION=$INFRACLASS_REGION >> ~/infraclass/config
INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]
echo INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=$INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID >> ~/infraclass/config
source infraclass/config
echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID

II. Modify the bash profile and create persistence
nano .profile
source infraclass/config
*Press Ctrl+O, ENTER to save the file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit nano.
Close and then re-open Cloud Shell to cycle the VM.*

echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
